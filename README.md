Notes/things I have done that may alter my model
    - there are many players on a 2019 roster but haven't played a game. This could be due to injury or because they haven't officially started with a team (free agent). Due to the limited games players have had this season, if they have 0 stats from this year I completely removed them from the roster. For most cases, this was not a big deal because there are some player that move between the g-league of each team and they aren't as a significant player. On the other hand, it was difficult for me to remove players like Andre Iguadola because I know how significant of a player he is. In the future, thise is a problem I can address. Due to the time constraints of this project, it is somethng I had to deal with.
